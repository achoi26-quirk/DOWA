      <p class="text-lg text-center mb-8">Recent events have led to increased visa revocations for international students. Below is an overview of the current situation and contributing factors.</p>
      <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2025 Visa Revocation Wave</h3>
        <p>In early 2025, the Trump administration intensified immigration enforcement, revoking over 1,800 student visas (F-1 and J-1) nationwide, with estimates as high as 5,000 SEVIS record terminations. The “Catch and Revoke” program, launched in January 2025, uses AI to monitor social media and flag students for perceived security risks, such as pro-Palestinian activism or minor infractions like traffic violations.</p>

      <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow_MD">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Administration’s Rationale</h3>
        <p>The administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, claims these actions target students involved in disruptive activities, such as campus protests related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, or those posing national security risks. However, many revocations lack clear explanations, and universities report students being targeted for minor or dismissed charges.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Impact on Students</h3>
        <p>South Korean students, among others, have been affected, with 14% of revocations impacting students from South Korea, China, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The lack of notice and due process has led to lawsuits, with some students securing temporary restraining orders to stay in the U.S. Universities likeHarvard face challenges, with some losing SEVP certification, affecting all international students.</p>
