      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Steps to Take if Your U.S. Visa is Revoked</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-center mb-8">If your U.S. visa has been revoked, follow these steps to understand your situation and explore your options:</p>
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Review the Revocation Notice</h3>
          <p>Check for a Notice of Intent to Revoke (NOIR) from the U.S. Department of State. This should explain why your visa was revoked (e.g., criminal activity, immigration violation, or administrative error). If you haven’t received a notice, contact the U.S. embassy or consulate that issued your visa to confirm its status.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Contact Your School’s International Office</h3>
          <p>If you’re an F-1 or J-1 visa holder, reach out to your school’s Designated School Official (DSO) or International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS). They can check your SEVIS record to see if it’s been terminated, which could affect your legal status.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Consult an Immigration Attorney</h3>
          <p>Seek legal advice immediately. An experienced immigration attorney can review your case, explain your rights, and guide you through appeals, reinstatement options, or new visa applications. This is critical, as visa revocations can be complex and case-specific.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Explore Your Options</h3>
          <p>Depending on your situation, you may apply for a new visa, request a status change, or prepare for voluntary departure. If you plan to travel outside the U.S., you’ll need a new visa to re-enter, which may require a medical exam or additional scrutiny. Avoid overstaying, as this could lead to penalties or bars from re-entry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">5. Contact the South Korean Consulate</h3>
          <p>For Korean students, the South Korean Consulate in Seattle can provide guidance and support. Reach out to discuss your case and explore assistance options. Visit the Contact page for details.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="text-center mt-6 italic">Note: Visa revocation does not always terminate your legal status in the U.S., but SEVIS termination may. Always consult official U.S. government resources or legal professionals for personalized advice.</p>
